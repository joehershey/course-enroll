Course Enroll - React Build

This project was created as part of the "Building User Interfaces" course I completed at UW-Madison in Fall 2020.

The goal was to use React, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to create a functional course-enrollment website. The websites features a search refinement feature, a "cart" for selected courses or sections, and a rating system for completed classes that then uses an algorithm to suggest courses. The website functions exactly as an enrollment site should, though it uses a VPN protected server that contains all course info, and is only accesible to UW students. Thus, it is not possible to run for yourself, so I am including a screen recording run through of the site and its functions. The video is accessible at this link: https://youtu.be/VMWpaYOdDQg
